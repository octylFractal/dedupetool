dedupetool
==========
A little tool for submitting FIDEDUPERANGE requests.

Files can either be provided in the `fdupes` format to stdin using `dedupetool stdin`,
or they can be discovered automatically using `dedupetool fclones`.

This repository also comes with a utility called `filefrag-rs`, which can report
extent information about a file.
